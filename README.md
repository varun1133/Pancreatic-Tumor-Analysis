# Pancreatic-Tumor-Analysis
The Pancreatic Tumor Analysis Project aims to develop an automated system for detecting, analyzing, and classifying pancreatic tumors using a combination of medical imaging (e.g., CT, MRI) and clinical data. Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive forms of cancer with a high mortality rate due to late detection.
